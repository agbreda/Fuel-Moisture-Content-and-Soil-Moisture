The python code in fmc_upscale.py was created to run direct in the command line because it takes about of 7h to run. Actually we
used the command "screen" in linux to start this program many times, each one for a different year, so we could have all the
upscaled FMC data in one night.

The following notebooks were used also:
> unite_files.ipynb: Read the pickle files for each created with the fmc_upscale.py and save all data in a netCDF4 file;
> fast_pearson.ipynb: Commpute the pearson linear correlation coefficient australia wide and create the maps for each soil
    moisture layer;
> stdev_oz_map.ipynb: Create the maps of standard deviation in each data series for each 5km pixel.
